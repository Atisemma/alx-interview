# 0x04. UTF-8 Validation

## Algorithm | Python

This project focuses on implementing a UTF-8 validation algorithm using Python. The main objective is to determine whether a given dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.

## Concepts

To successfully complete this project, you should be familiar with the following concepts:

1. **Bitwise Operations in Python**
   - Manipulating bits using AND (`&`), OR (`|`), XOR (`^`), NOT (`~`), and shifts (`<<`, `>>`)

2. **UTF-8 Encoding Scheme**
   - Understanding UTF-8 encoding rules
   - Recognizing patterns for valid UTF-8 encoded characters

3. **Data Representation**
   - Working with data at the byte level
   - Handling least significant bits (LSB) of integers

4. **List Manipulation in Python**
   - Iterating through lists
   - Accessing list elements
   - List comprehensions

5. **Boolean Logic**
   - Applying logical operations for decision-making

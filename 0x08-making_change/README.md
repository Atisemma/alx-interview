# 0x08. Making Change

## Algorithm | Python

This project focuses on solving the coin change problem, a classic challenge in the realm of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms. The goal is to determine the minimum number of coins needed to make up a given amount, given a list of coin denominations.

## Concepts Covered

1. **Greedy Algorithms**
   - Understanding and application of greedy algorithms
   - Recognizing limitations and appropriate use cases

2. **Dynamic Programming**
   - Basic principles and application to optimization problems
   - Concepts of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure

3. **Algorithmic Complexity**
   - Analysis of time and space complexity
   - Optimization for runtime efficiency

4. **Problem-Solving Strategies**
   - Breaking down complex problems into manageable sub-problems
   - Comparing iterative and recursive approaches

5. **Python Programming**
   - List manipulation and comprehensions
   - Efficient implementation of loops and conditional statements
